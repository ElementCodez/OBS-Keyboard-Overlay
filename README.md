# OBS-Keyboard-Overlay

Lets you display a keyboard on YouTube videos to show what buttons you are clicking!

# Description
The program works by reading the key that you click and showing you that key by turning the black keys into grey ones only when you click them! This program was made in a youtube video on my youtube channel found below if you are interested in how I made the program! I hope you enjoy the program! This program took 3 hours and lots of effort!
